# ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the **Resume-Rankr** project on your local machine.

---

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
First, download the project by cloning it from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arman1617/Resume-Rankr.git
cd Resume-Rankr
```

---

## **Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
Setting up a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are installed in an isolated space without affecting global Python packages.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
Depending on your operating system, use one of the following commands:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

To confirm the virtual environment is active, you should see **(env)** at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

---

## **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
Once inside the project directory and with the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including:
- `Flask` (for the web framework)
- `spaCy` (for NLP processing)
- `scikit-learn` (for machine learning algorithms)
- `python-docx` (for extracting text from `.docx` files)

---

## **Step 4: Download SpaCy NLP Model**
Since the project uses **spaCy** for NLP tasks, you need to download the necessary model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

This will install the small English NLP model required for extracting names and other text-based insights.

---

## **Step 5: Run the Flask Application**
Now that everything is installed, start the web application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

After running this command, the app will be available locally at:  
ðŸ‘‰ **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

---

## **Step 6: Upload Resumes & Job Description**
1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Upload one or more `.docx` resume files.
3. Enter the job description.
4. Click **Submit** to analyze and rank resumes based on their relevance.

---

## **Step 7: Download Ranked Resumes as CSV**
After ranking, you can download the results in CSV format.

1. Click the **Download CSV** button.
2. The ranked results will be saved as `ranked_resumes.csv`.

---

## **Step 8: Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**
When you're done working with the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

To reactivate it in the future, use the activation command from **Step 2**.

---

## âœ… **Installation Complete!**
Your **Resume-Rankr** project is now fully set up and ready to use. ðŸš€  
If you face any issues, feel free to check the project documentation or open an issue on GitHub.
